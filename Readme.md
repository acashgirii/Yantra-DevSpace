### Project Yantra

## About our Project

We made two robots which through communication would advance the supply chain management systems and reduce the time between the various logistical processes.

We are a team purely made of first years . We strive to make innovations in the field of Internet of Things (IoT).

## How it works

-> Robot R1 picks up the product from the warehouse. <br />
-> It then delivers the product infront of the Robot R2 and communicates its next destination using WiFi. <br />
-> The Robot R2 makes its way to the next destination with the product and delivers it infront of the Robot R1. <br />
-> Finally the Robot R1 delivers the product to its final destination. <br />

## Impact

This will help us drastically reduce the time which is otherwise wasted in transportation and other logistical processes by shortening the time complexity of comunication between two automated transiting vehicles connected over an IoT system. 

## Materials Used

-> ESP8266 WiFi module used for establishing an IoT connection between robots R1 and R2. <br />
-> A custom microcontroller based on Arduino Uno and programmed in Arduino language. <br />
-> HC-05 ultrasonic range finder module. <br />
-> TCS3200 color sensor module for perfectly sensing the colour specified pathway for travel done by the robots R1 and R2. <br />
-> Generic Metal parts for building the chasis or R1 and R2. <br />

## Inspiration 

The purpose of our study is to research and identify intrinsic and extrinsic motivations but also their impact on the behavioral intentions of using Internet of Things (IoT) solutions among company managers in India in the future. The research method used in the quantitative study was the sample survey.
